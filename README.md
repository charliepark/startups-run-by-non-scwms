## About

#### What is this?

A list of startups run by people who are not straight-cis-white-men. Would love your help adding to it!


#### Why?

I was inspired by the "About" section of [the Walker and Company](http://walkerandcompany.com/) site, and wanted to find more companies that didn't have the same straight, cis, white dude leadership team. I wasn't able to find a list, so I thought I'd make one.

I also added a "jobs" column in case you're looking to join a company with a diverse leadership team. (If you're interested in working with me at IFTTT (even though we aren't on this list), I'd love to tell you more! Email me!)


#### How do I add to it?

**If you have an account on GitHub:** Pull Requests are great! If you haven't done one before, I'd love to show you how to do one! Email me ([charlie@charliepark.org](charlie@charliepark.org)) and I'll walk you through it!

**If you don't have an account on GitHub:** Either send me a tweet ([@charliepark](https://twitter.com/charliepark)), or email me ([charlie@charliepark.org](charlie@charliepark.org)) and I'll update the list here.
